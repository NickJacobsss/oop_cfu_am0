# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
   * I felt extremely confident until the last part of challenge 3 and the final question, but I did eventually figure it out and I feel really good about making it work.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
   * great! I feel like I had plenty of breaks throughout the day everyday, and that kept my mind sharp
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
   * I have a great support system, and im happy with my desk setup. I just need to mentally prepare for this to be long term.
